# Introduction to HTML Learning

Welcome to the exciting world of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the fundamental language used in web development! Learning HTML is a fantastic first step towards creating stunning websites and web applications. To embark on this journey, you only need two essential tools: a browser and a text editor.

## Necessary Software:

1. **Browser:**
   - Choose a modern and widely-used web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Browsers are essential for previewing your HTML code and seeing how it renders on the web.

2. **Text Editor:**
   - Select a text editor to write and edit your HTML code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. These editors offer features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion, making your coding experience smoother.

## Understanding HTML:

HTML is the backbone of web development, providing the structure for web pages. It uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. As you delve into HTML, you'll learn how to structure content, create forms, and enhance your web pages with multimedia.
